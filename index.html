            <h3>London, the city of unique and magnificent landmarks</h3>
            <p>
              London is probably the only one city that has emerged from every
              single period in its two thousand years of history, more
              impressive, more diverse and more generously endowed with the gems
              of a remarkable civilisation.It has a very diverse collection,
              from hundred years old castles and cathedrals to unique galleries
              and cultural hubs, from famous sights, easily recognisable all
              over the world to special hidden gems that pop up when you least
              expect it.
            </p>
            <p>
              World-renowned architects, like Norman Foster (The Gherkin), Renzo
              Piano (The Shard), John Nash (Regent Street) or the likes of
              Christopher Wren (St Paul's Cathedral), John Soane (Bank of
              England) or Charles Barry (Houses of Parliament), have put their
              incredible talent to great use to create some of the most striking
              designs that have shaped the London landscape and skyline as we
              know it today.
